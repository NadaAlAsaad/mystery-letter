In the "Mystery Letter" project, I created a Python program that encrypts and decrypts secret messages using a Caesar cipher. This project, from Raspberry Pi, taught me the basics of cryptography and how to implement it in code. I designed a program that takes a message and a shift value as input, then applies the Caesar cipher to encrypt the message. The program also includes a decryption function to retrieve the original message. Through this project, I learned about the importance of cryptography in secure communication and gained hands-on experience with Python programming.
